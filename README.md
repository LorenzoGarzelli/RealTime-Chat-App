This project aimed to create a real-time (simplified) messaging system that uses end-to-end encryption mechanisms to ensure confidentiality and privacy of communications among users.
This project is composed of both a backend (written in Express + TypeScript) and a frontend part (written in React + TypeScript).

## Demo

### sending a message in case the recipient is online

### sending a message in case the recipient is offline

### sending a message in case of no internet connection

## Tech Stack

**Backend**:

- Express.js (web framework)
- MongoDB (used for storing users account data and friendships data )
- Redis (used for storing chat messages (and messages ack) waiting to be delivered to the recipient )
- Twilio (used for sending sms , in the process of Sign In , to the phone number specified by te user, in order to verify the phone number )

**Frontend**:

- React
- SWR (React Hooks for Data Fetching)
- Dexie.js (a wrapper for indexedDB, used for storing chat messages and other data(such as: cryptographic keys, roomId for WS connections, ecc...))

## End-to-end encryption Overview

In this chat app, the end-to-end encryption has been implemented, using the **ECDH** (Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman) for the key agreement protocol and **AES-GCM** (AES in Galois/Counter Mode) for authenticated encryption protocol.

Brief overview of how end-to-end encryption works in this chat app:

- **Key Generation**: Each user has a unique pair of cryptographic keys for each friendship ( a public key and a private key). The public key is shared with the server and with the friend via WS (so if the friend is online , once he receive the public key, recomputes the shared key) , while the private key is kept secret on the user device.

- **Shared Key Derivation**: Each user, using their own private key and the public key (of the friend), each party computes a shared key, for symmetric encryption-decryption

- **Encryption / Decryption**: Once the shared key has been derived, it is utilized by both friends to encrypt and decrypt all messages they exchange with each other
